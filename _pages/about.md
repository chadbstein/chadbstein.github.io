I received my PhD from Harvard University in April 2023. I performed my dissertation research in [Karen Adelman's](https://adelman.hms.harvard.edu/) lab, where I studied how the Integrator complex induces premature transcription termination. I used a variety of techniques, including CRISPR genome editing and nascent transcriptomics. My work was partly supported by an [NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein Predoctoral Individual National Research Service Award (F31)](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/x4q8OW-il0-dIloxPd4xyg/project-details/10536610).

During my graduate studies, I received a [Teaching Certificate from the Bok Center for Teaching and Learning](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/teaching-certificate). I also received a Certificate of Distinction in Teaching and completed an [Undergraduate Mentoring Workshop Series](https://careernavigator.gradeducation.hms.harvard.edu/fas-science-education-mentoring-undergraduates-certificate-series). I served as a producer for [Sit'N Listen](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/category/podcast/), the podcast of Harvard's science communication group [Science in the News](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/).

In August 2023, I will begin a postdoctoral position in [Britt Glaunsinger's](https://glaunsingerlab.berkeley.edu/) lab at UC Berkeley where I will study how gamma herpesviruses co-opt the host transcription machinery to express their own genes. I am excited to expand my conceptual and experimental toolbox in addition to gaining experience in teachng and mentorship.
